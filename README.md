## Syllabus

This Graduate-level topics course aims at offering a glimpse into the emerging mathematical questions around Deep Learning. In particular, we will focus on the different geometrical aspects surounding these models, from input geometric stability priors to the geometry of optimization, generalisation and learning. We will cover both the background and the current open problems. 

Besides the lectures, we will also run a parallel curricula (optional), following the [Depth First Learning](www.depthfirstlearning.com) methodology. We will start with an inverse curriculum on the [Neural ODE paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07366) by Chen et al.

### DistributionalRL: [Living document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bk6txed3bjvPBsWF26HD4xab-iUylHtA7vGXfP4QFew/edit?usp=sharing)

* Class 1: Basics of RL and Q learning
  * Required Reading:
    * [Sutton and Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2017nov5.pdf) (Ch 3, Ch 4, Ch 5, Ch 6.5)
      * The standard introduction to RL.  Focus in Chapter 3 on getting used to the notation we’ll use throughout the module, and an introduction to the Bellman operator and fixed point equations.  In Chapter 4 the most important idea is value iteration (and exercise 4.10 will ask you to show why iterating the Q function is basically the same algorithm).
      * Chapter 5 considers using full rollouts to estimate our value / Q function, rather than the DP updates.  Focus on the difference between on-policy and off-policy, which will be relevant to the final algorithm.
      * Including 6.5 is an introduction to Q-learning in practice, updating one state-action pair at a time (without worrying about function approximation yet).
    * [Contraction Mapping Theorem](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~hunter/book/ch3.pdf) (3.1)
      * We’ll need the notion of contractions repeatedly throughout the module.  Their essential property is a unique fixed point, and you should have a clear understanding of the constructive proof of this fixed point (don’t worry about the ODE applications).
  * Questions:
    * Exercise 3.14, Exercise 4.10 in S & B
    * Prove the Bellman operator contracts Q functions with regard to the infinity norm
    * What is a sanity-check lower bound on complexity for Q learning?  Why might this be infeasible for RL problems in the wild?

  * Motivation: The adjoint method is a numerical method for efficiently computing the gradient of a function in numerical optimization problems.

    * In DE, why does eq. (4.2) imply convergence t   as t ?
    * What is the computational complexity of evaluating a determinant of a N x N matrix, and why is that relevant in this context?

    * Do you understand why adding ‘residual layers’ should not degrade the network performance?
    * How do the authors of (Multi-level […]) explain the phenomena of still having almost as good performances in residual networks when removing a layer?
    * Implement your favourite variant ResNet variant
